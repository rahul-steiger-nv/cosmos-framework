"""Abstract interfaces for persistent memory in the MoT transformer stack.

``MemoryState`` is a *mutable* Python object that lives **outside** the
``torch.compile`` boundary.  It is responsible for reading cached tensors
(``read_for_layer``) and writing new tensors back (``write_for_layer``).

``MemoryValue`` is a *read-only* tensor container that is safe to pass
**into** a compiled decoder layer.  Concrete implementations are plain
dataclasses whose fields are tensors (or None).  No methods on
``MemoryValue`` should mutate state.

``KVToStore`` is a type alias for the 4-tuple of tensors
``(gen_k, gen_v, und_k, und_v)`` returned by each compiled layer so
the caller can write them back into the cache outside the compile boundary.
